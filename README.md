# About Me
![Alt Text](IMG_7053.jpg)
My name is Deja Robinson (she/her) and I am currently pursuing a dual masters degrees at Carnegie Mellon University for Biomedical Engineering and Engineering & Technology Innovation Management. I want to save lives in my career, and hope to earn a position for medical device product management for a leading medical device company. 
My Motto for my life is: 

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.

I graduate this year in May (YES!), and I will be starting my career as a Field Engineer/Medical Device Sales Specialist for GE Healthcare in June. 

When I'm not in class or doing homework, I'm very passionate about videogames, playing my instuments, and starting my secondary career as a DJ. My father gifted me his setup, I have no idea how to use it so- anyone reading if you have any suggestions I'll take them!
