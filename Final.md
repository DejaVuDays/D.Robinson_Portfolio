# Pressing through the pain, How compression mammogramy is limiting patient outcome

## The Idea 
[link to Part 1][wireframe.md]

I wanted to create a document to help my readers learn more about the current state of breast imaging technology and display the gaps between pratient needs and what is being satisfied. Breast Imaging can be painful and is often overlooked by our current healthcare system. Exposing these gaps can insipre readers to act today, educate thier loved ones, and consider dontating to a research foundation that first supports patientsâ€™ needs.

A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story. (Part I)

The proposed story arc I'd like to follow:

### Introduction
Introduction to why I am currently intersted in improving breast imaging. As a future breast imaging specalist, I went through this process so I could better understand what patients are going through when they follow through with thier screening. The narrative will be driven by my personal questions as an engineer and as a woman, and will shift to include information I found to answer my questions.

### Breast Cancer
I want to report current breast cancer cases, expected cases for this year and survival rates when compared to other cancers women commonly get. I want to also explore risk factors for certian populations and see how imaging impacts these rates. 

### How Mammogramy Works
I want to do a general introduction of the imaging modality so everyone can get a gist of what happens during the procedure and what could possibly be the source of pain, axeity, and other barriers preventing women from attending thier annual screenings.

### What are the current issues?
I want to explore the current issures in diagnosing cancer and the dig into what may be a barrier preventing patients from attending screenings. 

### Exploration on how we can address issues:
I hope to find companies/technologies addressing prior discussed insues. 

### Call to Action
At the end, I want to have multiple calls of action to address the wide population of people I'm aiming my site to deal with. I want others to do self breast exams, tell thier friends, innocate and create new technologies, as well as donate to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. 

The majority of my data is coming from peer reviewed academic sources. [Here are my publicly accessible data sources] (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ntjsFZNc2vz-7FywFQ2_oNp1egFd9Q0o?usp=sharing).

I will be using Microsoft Powerpoint, Datawrapper, Inkscape, and GIMP to create my images and data vizulizations. My final project will be displayed in Shorthand.

## Design and User Research

### Sketches, storyboards and wireframes

I explored with color and mood photos for my storyboard sketch. I used for my user feedback rounds:

## User research protocol and findings 

My goal is to target young individuals passionate about the improvement of healthcare. This could include healthcare innovators and health care providers. I will do so by approaching individuals who are working in healthcare or aligning themselves to enter the healcare industry. 

Script: 

Hello! My name is Deja and I'm creating a short interactive document about patient desired improvements in breast imaging. I currently have a powerpoint presentation, however this is just a wireframe for a scrollable interactive site such as this. *Display an example Shorthand site* Is now a bad time to speak about possible improvements I could make in this presentation?

Also, is it alright that I record you? 

I will only be using characteristics you give me to depict you in your interview for my report such as age, gender, and career. 

Let's get started! Per slide, I will ask you three questions and at the end we will have two wrap up questions.

Per Slide: 
1. Is anything causing confusion on this slide?
2. What questions do you have? How might I address them on this slide?
3. Is the data vizulation aestheticly pleaseing? 

After Entire Presentation: 
1. What is missing from this presentation? 
2. Who do you think this site is for? 
3. Any other remarks? 

## Interview Findings
I've included the quotes I found the most impactful for my experince: 

A: Female, 25, Speciality: Brain Imaging, Research Adolecent Mental Health, Card Carring Feminist

"I like that you're using includive language here. It's very important to address that population- espically when you start your presentation saying that everyone has breasts....everyone. But, if you chose to be inclusive in your language be sure to be inclusinve in your data selection as well. Did you use and trans specific papers?"

"I see this site aligned for an entry level engineering or business student, trying to discover a pain point so they can deliver a solution rather than an idividual trying to get information on how thier firt imaging session would be like and why they're going throuhg with it," 

B: Male, 25, Speciality: Brain Imaging, Biomedical Research.

"Compression doesn't make sense for imaging at all. I don't have to squeeze people's brains to get a clear imagge of what's going on in there...  Is it xray? I need more information on why this is a standard procedure- not just doctors refusing to adapt new modalities because mammograms are just what they do...you know? Pretty much I'm saying I want to know why doctors are doing this, why compression is specificly used for breast imaging and nothing else,"

"I think this site is for women...and men who have women in their lives and are curious about keeping thier health," 

C: Female, 23, Speciality: CMU Biomedical Graduate Student. 

"This site is for people who are empathetic, and truly care about people's emotions during thier healthcare experience...and also what follows them home when they're done," 

"I wish there was more information about compression. The image of the boobs being squished is uncomfortable...and I hate that, but I understand why you chose to depict it like that because I didn't know that's how it happened....But I'm a woman and I'm going to have to deal with that and...i'm not excited for it. But as an engineer, I want to know why we are using that technology," 
Final data story

These invervies helped me narrow down my focus, while adding conent I had originally overlooked to ensure I had a full story.

A few paragraphs that summarize the work you've done so far.  Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process. (Part III)
Include a link to your updated Github repository that includes a link to your final data story (e.g. a link to your Shorthand / StoryMap or other final project).  Make sure your data story is published and publicly accessible. (Part III)
Add a link to your final data story (a direct link to Shorthand / StoryMap / etc.) placed in the final presentation spreadsheet here (Links to an external site.).  Add the link next to your name in the spreadsheet, and update the title to reflect the working title for your presentation.  (Part III)
Include all references for materials used.  It's your responsibility to ensure you have permission to use imagery and other assets, and that you use them appropriately.  A reminder to NOT USE COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - see the library's guide to ensure you are using images correctlyLinks to an external site..  Make sure to add / update any citations and / or other content that you used to create your data story.  References should also be clearly identified on your final data story itself.  (Part III)
Include any other information that helps round out your data story. (Part III)
